I am a graduate student in the Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence integrated M.S. & Ph.D. program at [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr). My research interests are in Robustness, Semantic Segmentation, Domain Adaptation, and Generalization. I am a member of the [Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/) at POSTECH, working with Prof. [Suha Kwak](https://suhakwak.github.io).
