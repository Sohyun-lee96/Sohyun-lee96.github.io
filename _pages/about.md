I am a graduate student in the Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence integrated M.S. & Ph.D. program at [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr). I am a member of the [Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/) at POSTECH, advised by Prof. [Suha Kwak](https://suhakwak.github.io). 
Previously, I completed my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at POSTECH.\
\
My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning. I've worked on the robust recognition in adverse visual conditions, domain adaptation, and generalization. 

If you are interested in my research projects, please feel free to contact me.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.


Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
